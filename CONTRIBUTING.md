### Contributing

- Currently the Model View Presenter architectural pattern is being used. Please ensure that is adhered to.
- In lieu of a formal style guide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. 
- Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality (the coverage is not yet a 100%, this needs to be improved).
- Ensure that local build (which compiles the solution and runs all the unit tests) passes.
- The installers for all Windows, Mac OS X and Linux are built by CI builds as detailed [here](continuous-integration.md)
